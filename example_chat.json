This collection includes major brands that regularly invest in the high-profile, multi-million dollar ad slots during America's biggest sporting event.\n\n## Portfolio Overview\n\nThe portfolio captures a diverse range of industries that recognize the massive marketing opportunity of the Super Bowl:\n\n- **Tech giants** like Meta, Google, and Amazon that use the platform to showcase their latest innovations\n- **Food and beverage companies** including PepsiCo, Kellanova (Pringles), and General Mills\n- **Automotive manufacturers** such as Stellantis, GM, and Ford\n- **Consumer services** like Uber, GoDaddy, and Skechers\n- **Media companies** like Fox Corporation that benefit from broadcasting the event\n\nMany of these companies see the Super Bowl as a critical marketing moment to reach over 100 million viewers at once. This portfolio represents brands with substantial marketing budgets that view the significant investment (approximately $7 million for a 30-second spot) as worthwhile for brand building and consumer awareness.\n\nWould you like me to adjust this portfolio in any way? Perhaps focus on specific industries within Super Bowl advertisers or modify the allocation strategy?"
